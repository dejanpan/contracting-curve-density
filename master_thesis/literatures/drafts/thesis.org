Title: *Implementation of Contracting Curve Density Algorithm for Applications in Personal Robotics*


Abstract:

Objective of the thesis is to implement a Contracting Curve Density (CCD) algorithm, a method for fitting 
parametric curve models to boundaries of image regions, in the ecosystem of Robot Operating System 
(ROS, http://www.ros.org).
After the implementation phase the algorithm is to be tested for the following applications:
- objects of daily use detection using CAD models objects,
- tracking of objects of daily use,
- robust camera to laser calibration using 2D to 3D curve correspondences.
