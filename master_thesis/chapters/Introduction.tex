\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:Introduction}
In the field of computer vison and pattern recognition, determining a
model from a finite set of samples or a complex image without prior
knowledge is an ill-posed problem. Due to the the ill-posedness, in
the sense that a unique model may not exist, models specifying a priori
knowledge plays an very important role in solving many important
computer vision problems, such as object tracking, shape recognition,
pose estimation segmentation, edge detection, stereo matching and 3-D
reconstruction.

Some parametric curve models, also known as deformable models,
deformable templates, snakes, or active contours, have been delevoped
to guide the image interpretation process towards particularly
likely interpretations~\cite{hanek2004fitting}. These parametric curve models, namely
prior knowledge have two outstanding influences in the
development of related algorithms. The first is the Snakes which
represent a fundamentally new framework for delineating an object
outline in an image. This framework attempts to minimize energy
associated to the current contour as a sum of an internal and external
energy~\cite{kass1988snakes}. The goal of snakes is to balance the prior
knowledge with evidence from an image. The second outstanding
influence is in the field of pattern recognition and machine learning,
where statistical distributions plays a key role.  There treatment
of prior knowledge about shape is put into a probabilistic
context. Any shape is regarded as the result of applying some
distortion to an ideal prototype shape, and an appropriate
distribution governs the nature and extent of that distortion.
For both kinds of methods, the common aim is to strengthen the visual
interpretation of the shape via the establishing influence of prior
expectations of the shapes that are likely to be seen~\cite{blake1998active}. This
thesis dwells upon the Contracting Curve Density (CCD) algorithm whose
basic step is solving a curve-fitting problem in a probabilistic
context.


\section{The CCD algorithm and curve-fitting problem}
\label{sec:ccdcfp}
The curve-fitting is a process that makes
a practical deformable template (model) attached to the feature in a
image. In essence it involves using algorithms to find the parameter
values for a given parametric curve model. Lots of important and
challenging computer vision tasks can be formulated as variants of the
curve-fitting problem. The nature of a curve-fitting problem is taken into account from the
outset, usually it is quite unnecessary to examine an entire
image. Hence, there is no need to organise or group features in the
image, and the analysis can be restricted to a relatively narrow
ROI (region of interest), so it is usually expected to be computationally
cheaper.

The CCD algorithm can be described as follows. Given one or multiple images as input
data and a parametric curve model with a prior distribution of model
parameters, through curve-fitting process we estimate the model
parameters which determine the approximation of the posterior
distribution in order to make the curve models best matching image data.
~\ref{fig:fitting} depicts a curve-fitting problem and the
corresponding solution is obtained by the
CCD algorithm.

    parameters determining the posterior distribution. During the
    fitting process, the uncertainty of contours of the ball is widely
    reduced.}

\section{Motivation of the CCD Approach}
\label{sec:mccd}
The curve-fitting problem and its variants have a wide range of
applications in the field of robotics, medical processing, user
interface, surveillance and biometrics~\cite{hanek2004fitting}. In order to be
widely applicable to practical computer vision problems, the following
requirements, such as robustness,
accuracy, efficiency, any-time property and versatility, should be
considered when a novel approach is designed and implemented.
However, in the computer vision community, solving object segmentation and the
related object contour tracking problems are always challenging,
especially in natural and unconstrained scenes. Due to clutter,
shading, texture, and highlights it is very difficulty to segment
an object from an inhomogeneous background. Furthermore, some physical
conditions, such as the illumination or surface properties, will
influence the efficiency and stability of related approaches. It is
necessary and important to develop a method which determines adequate segmentation
in advance or a single criterion that is applicable
for all parts of objects boundaries.

Among the currently available methodologies, the CCD algorithm is an
interesting one. It is developed and presented as a state-of-the-art
improvement over other advanced techniques such as the condensation
algorithm~\cite{panin2006fully}. In the CCD approach, the curve-fitting problem is
put in the context of probabilistic framework and converted to a
regression one in the field of pattern recognition. It is especially
helpful to touch the nature of curve-fitting problem. By introducing
local image statistics, the algorithm can cope with highly
inhomogeneous image regions and provide therefore locally adapted
criteria for separating the adjacent image regions. The use of blurred
curve models as efficient means for iteratively optimizing the
posterior density over possible model parameters. These blurred curve
models enables the algorithm to trade-off two conflicting objectives,
namely heaving a large area of convergence and achieving high
accuracy. The CCD algorithm achieves a high level of robustness and subpixel
accuracy even in the presence of severe texture, shading, clutter,
partial occlusion, and strong changes of illumination.

The robustness, runtime and accuracy of the CCD algorithm enable it 
to be used on personal robot  because many applications in the field
of personal robotics are time-constrained. The object's contour
obtained by the CCD algorithm can be used to locate the object and
establish a set of safe grasps on it~\cite{hanek2000vision}.




\section{The Contracting Curve Density (CCD) Approach}
\label{sec:sketch}

\subsection{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

In the field of pattern recognition, the key concept is that of
uncertainty. In image data, the uncertainty arises both
through noise from measurements, as well as through the nature of
the objects. Probability theory provides a consistent framework for the
quantification and manipulation of uncertainty.  In this section, we
view curve-fitting problem from a probabilistic perspective and turn
us towards to Bayesian treatment.


We assume that a parametric curve model is governed by a prior distribution
over the model parameters $\Phi$ (usually a $D$-dimensional
vector). There exists a range of probability distributions which can
be used to model the distribution of shapes. In this thesis, for
simplicity, let us consider the Gaussian distribution, which is commonly
used in computer vison because of its several outstanding features.

% \begin{equation}
%   \label{eq:1.1}
%   p(\mathbf{\Phi} | \mathbf{m}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}, \mathbf{\mathbf{\Sigma}}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\Phi} |
%   \mathbf{m}_{\mathbf{\Phi}},\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}) =
%   \frac{1}{(2\pi )^{D/2}} \frac{1}{|\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}|^{1/2}}
% \mathrm{exp} \left\{ -\frac{1}{2} (\mathbf{\Phi} -
%   \mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\Phi}})^T \mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}^{-1} (\mathbf{\Phi} -
%   \mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}) \right\}
% \end{equation}
% where the $D$-dimensional vector $\mathbf{m}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}$ is
% called the mean, the $D \times D$ matrix
% $ \mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\Phi}} $ is called
% the covariance, and $|\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}|$ denotes the
% determinant of $\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathbf{\Phi}}$

Defining the prior distribution is only a step of the problem. Prior knowledge
defines the possibility of a shape in an image, if we want to know what
shape is presented in a given image, we must find the posterior
distribution. According to the Bayesian theorem, posterior distribution
is proportional to the product of prior distribution and the likelihood
function. Hence, the next step is to define the likelihood function.

In the implementation of the CCD algorithm, it is suggested to use local image pixels $\mathcal{L}$ as the training data to
determine the likelihood function. If the data is assumed to be drawn
 independently from the distribution, then the likelihood function is
given by the accumulation of all the components.
By pixel value we denote the vector containing the local single-or multichannel
image data associated to a pixel. In our experiments, we directly use the sensed RGB
values as pixel values. However, other types of local features computed in a pre-processing
step may also be used, e.g. texture descriptors or color values in
other color spaces.

With the prior distribution and posterior distribution, we can now
apply the Bayesian treatment to the curve-fitting problem.
We determine $\hat{\mathbf{\Phi}}$ by finding the most probable
value of $\mathbf{\Phi}$ given by the data, in other words by maximizing
the posterior distribution. This technique is called maximum
posterior, or simply MAP.

There are several methods to estimate the MAP~\cite{map}:
\begin{itemize}
\item In some special cases, posterior distribution can be given in
  closed form analytically. This requires conjugate priors.
\item Numerical optimization such as the conjugate gradient method or
  Newton's method.
\item Modification of an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm,
  which does not require to derive the posterior density.
\item Monte Carlo method using simulated annealing.
\end{itemize}

In this thesis, we adopt the second method to obtain the MAP estimate.
Usually, the results are some parameters (e.g. mean and covariance) to
govern the posterior distribution. With the resulting parameters we
can predict what shape is actually likely to be present in a particular image.


\subsection{Possible problems}
\label{sec:prob}
In order to implement the MAP estimation above, we have to address
three questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item How to create a parametric curve model as prior knowledge , and
  at the same time determine the distribution? There are a variety of
  active shape models available, such as principally snakes,
  deformable templates and dynamic contours. For curve-fitting
  problem, deformable template is a good choice to match the image
  data. Then we have to choose a suitable number of parameters to control
  the strength of prior assumptions. If there are too many parameters
  in the model, it is easy to control the contour accurately at the
  expense of complexity and computational cost. Balance among these
  aspects are non-trivial.

\item How can the local statistics in the image be evaluated? First, it
  is necessary to establish the relation between the model parameters
  $\mathbf{\Phi}$ and the image data $\mathcal{L}$. This is especially
challenging in the presence of clutter and strong texture if we
consider the factors, such as  illumination, surface properties,
characteristics of the camera and shadow. 

\item How can the fit be optimized efficiently? Generally MAP and some
  other nonlinear optimization algorithms may find multiple local
  maxima and are not guaranteed to find the largest out of these maxima.
\end{itemize}


For the first question, we will use parametric B-Spline curve as
our prior knowledge. It is proved that this kind of curve model is
flexible enough and can well represent the contour of the object. The
parametric B-Spline curve will be described in Chapter~\ref{chapter:bspline}.
The second question is especially challenging. In order to simplify
the problem, it is necessary to make some assumptions about the image
data. We will describe such assumptions in more detail. For the last
question, different optimization methods used for curve-fitting will
be discussed in this thesis.

\subsection{Sketch of the CCD algorithm}
\label{sec:sccd}

In this section, the basic steps of the CCD algorithm will be
sketched. Given an input image as training data, we first choose an initial
contour for an object or feature which will be fitted or tracked, and
some initial values for the means, covariances. Then we alternate
between the following two updates that we shall call the learning
local statistics step and the refining parameters step, for reasons
that will become apparent shortly.
In the step of learning local statistics, for each pixel $\nu$ in the
vicinity of the expected curve, two sets of local statistics
are computed, one set for each side of the curve. The local statistics are obtained from
pixels that are close to $nu$ pixel and most likely lie on the corresponding side of the curve,
according to the current estimate of the model parameters. The resulting local statistics
represent an expectation of "what the two sides of the curve look
like"~\cite{hanek2004contracting}.

% The CCD algorithm has some interesting similarities to the Expectation-Maximization
% (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977), which is often used for clustering-based image
% segmentation, a subset of region-based image segmentation (Hermes et al., 2002; Belongie
% et al., 1998). The first step computes local statistics defining an expectation of the pixel
% values (E-step). The second step maximizes this expectation
% (M-step). The CCD algorithm differs mainly by: 1.) using local
% statistics, 2.) exploiting a curve model and optimizing model
% parameters rather than pixel classifications.
